## Introduction

I studied Multimedia Technology at the University of Applied Sciences in Mittweida.
During that time I built the online ticket platform www.scantickets.de in my spare 
time and I also was a very active member of the German www.flashforum.de.

I finished my degree with a theoretical and practical thesis on a new enterprise 
content management system (www.redaktoer.info).

I startet working at a small Communication and Advertising Agency based in Zwickau, 
Germany after I got my degree as Graduate Engineer (FH) in 2008. There I have been 
working with a small team of 20 people (designers, developers, 3d artists and managers). 
I worked as a web and application developer till now, with experience in a wide range of 
industries, and a skillset which includes programming, UI/UX, graphic design, business 
strategy and planning, and marketing. Throughout my career I have been privileged to 
work on projects which interfaced with industry giants such as Audi, Volkswagon, 
ArcelorMittal and Wismut (mining company).

The last years I´ve fallen in love with JavaScript and mobile Devices. I love to dive 
deeply into a JavaScript framework and try to understand how they solving various 
JavaScript issues or how they are implementing OOP or other paradigm. I´m also a big 
fan of the open source community and developed software with and for it.

I love Web-Technology. It is my passion, and I want to continue developing the skills 
I have been building over the last decade.

## Experience

**Work at ö_konzept - Agentur für Werbung und Kommunikation GmbH & Co. KG**   
2008 - now   
I am lead developer of a 4-person team (team leader, me and two other developers). We build Webpages and intranet systems for SMEs. 
We also did some browser based applications for human resource planning, property management and for the health sector.   
//todo

**SCANtickets.de**   
2005 - now   
Our small team consists of two persons, a manager and designer in one person and me. I got a user interaction and web layout 
and build the content management system and website from ground up. The CMS doesn´t use any framework, except ADOdb for PHP.
After this was done, I build a entry software (ticket validation) based on C#.
SCANtickets works like ebay. A person can register and start selling self-printable event tickets. Before the event starts, 
the user can download a so called "ticket-archive" (SQL Lite file). The C#-based entry software will open this database (offline).
The visitors arrive with self-printed tickets, these get scanned and validated.

Later on SCANtickets.de was merged into the firm I worked at - ö_konzept.
