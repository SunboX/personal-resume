## Introduction

I studied Multimedia Technology at the University of Applied Sciences in Mittweida.
During that time I built the online ticket platform www.scantickets.de in my spare 
time and I also was a very active member of the German www.flashforum.de.

I finished my degree with a theoretical and practical thesis on a new enterprise 
content management system (www.redaktoer.info).

I startet working at a small Communication and Advertising Agency based in Zwickau, 
Germany after I got my degree as Graduate Engineer (FH) in 2007. There I have been 
working with a small team of 20 persons (designers, developers, 3d artists and managers). 
I worked as a web and application developer till now, with experience in a wide range of 
industries, and a skillset which includes programming, UI/UX, graphic design, business 
strategy and planning, and marketing. Throughout my career I have been privileged to 
work on projects which interfaced with industry giants such as Audi, Volkswagon, 
ArcelorMittal and Wismut (mining company).

The last years I´ve fallen in love with JavaScript and mobile Devices. I love to dive 
deeply into a JavaScript framework and try to understand how they solving various 
JavaScript issues or how they are implementing OOP or other paradigm. I´m also a big 
fan of the open source community and developed software with and for it.

I love Web-Technology. It is my passion, and I want to continue developing the skills 
I have been building over the last decade.
